        <li>I had the pleasure of working with Stacey for a little over two years at Total Care Auto Powered by Landcar. Stacey is an extremely proactive and dependable employee. She wants to understand the whole process before completing the task, which made her very successful in her job as an Accounting Clerk. Stacey demonstrated high attention to detail by identifying several errors in our accounting processes. She always looks for ways to make her daily job more efficient.
